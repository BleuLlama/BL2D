This is a few Xcode project example pseudo-templates that you can
use either in-situ, or by using the "copyTemplate.pl" script, you
can make a renamed copy of these to be the starting point for your
own implementation.

From a terminal prompt, go to this directory and type:

	perl copyTemplate.pl

And then follow the prompts to instantiate a copy of the packaged
project that you pick.
